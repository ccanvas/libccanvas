# Paint

This bundle utilises spaces as "workspaces".

I would recommend looking the 2 components in the following order:

1. [`paint-manager`](./paint-manager)
2. [`paint-canvas`](./paint-canvas)

## How to run this component

- [`ccanvas`](https://github.com/ccanvas/ccanvas) installed in system.
- Install all 2 components components using `cargo install --path .`

Start the canvas using the command below.

```sh
ccanvas paint ccanvas-paint
```

## Component structure
